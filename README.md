# AI Chatbot

A minimalist AI chatbot that reads from a data folder to generate responses based on the content of the files within. This project demonstrates a simple server-side implementation using Node.js and Express.

## Project Overview

The AI Chatbot is designed to provide responses based on file contents stored in a designated data directory. It mimics AI behavior by selecting random content from these files. The server communicates through a RESTful API for chat functionalities and handles basic error management to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Features

- RESTful API for chat messaging.
- Dynamic responses based on the contents of text files.
- Middleware for parsing request bodies and serving static files.
- Error handling for various operational scenarios, including server initialization and file I/O.

## Installation

To get started with the AI Chatbot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ai-chatbot.git
   cd ai-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a data directory:**
   Inside the project root, create a directory named `data` where your text files will reside.

4. **Run the application:**
   Start the server using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` or use a tool like Postman to interact with the API.

## Usage

To interact with the chatbot, send a POST request to the `/chat` endpoint with a JSON body containing your message, like so:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, how does AI work?"
}
```

The server will respond with a JSON object that provides a response based on the contents of the text files in the `data` directory.

### Example Request (using curl)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "What is the weather like?"}'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "response": "Basandomi sui dati disponibili in 'example.txt', posso dirti che... [Simulazione risposta AI]",
  "source": "example.txt"
}
```
